The Art Shop web application includes a store front, shopping cart, checkout page, and order confirmation page. A comprehensive administrative area allows the administrator to view and manage customers and orders. A reporting section is where both pre-packaged and ad-hoc reports are generated. An attractive dashboard page with charts summarizes business performance and statistcs.

The first project, Art.Web, contains the Presentation layer. The second project, Art.Domain, holds the remainder of the application including the Service, Business, and Data Access layers. A perfect, yet simple structure to work with.

The Spark Application has 4 layers: 
  - The Presentation layer provides the UI (user interface) and the user experience 
  - The Service layer offers a simple query and service interface for the UI code 
  - The Business layer offers the business objects with business rules, and 
  - The Data Access layer provides fast data access to and from the database
